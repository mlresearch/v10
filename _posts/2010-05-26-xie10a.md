title: Learning Dissimilarities for Categorical Symbols
abstract: In this paper we learn a dissimilarity measure for categorical data, for
  effective classification of the data points. Each categorical feature (with values
  taken from a finite set of symbols) is mapped onto a continuous feature whose values
  are real numbers. Guided by the classification error based on a nearest neighbor
  based technique, we repeatedly update the assignment of categorical symbols to real
  numbers to minimize this error. Intuitively, the algorithm pushes together points
  with the same class label, while enlarging the distances to points labeled differently.
  Our experiments show that 1) the learned dissimilarities improve classification
  accuracy by using the affinities of categorical symbols; 2) they outperform dissimilarities
  produced by previous data-driven methods; 3) our enhanced nearest neighbor classifier
  (called LD) based on the new space is competitive compared with classifiers such
  as decision trees, RBF neural networks, Naive Bayes and support vector machines,
  on a range of categorical datasets.
