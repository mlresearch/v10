title: Feature Extraction for Outlier Detection in High-Dimensional Spaces
abstract: This work addresses the problem of feature extraction for boosting the performance
  of outlier detectors in high-dimensional spaces. Recent years have observed the
  prominence of multidimensional data on which traditional detection techniques usually
  fail to work as expected due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper introduces
  an efficient feature extraction method which brings nontrivial improvements in detection
  accuracy when applied on two popular detection techniques. Experiments carried out
  on real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of feature extraction in outlier detection.
