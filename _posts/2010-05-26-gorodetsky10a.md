title: 'Feature Extraction for Machine Learning: Logic-Probabilistic Approach'
abstract: The paper analyzes peculiarities of preprocessing of learning data represented
  in object data bases constituted by multiple relational tables with ontology on
  top of it. Exactly such learning data structures are peculiar to many novel challenging
  applications. The paper proposes a new technology supported by a number of novel
  algorithms intended for ontology-centered transformation of heterogeneous possibly
  poor structured learning data into homogeneous informative binary feature space
  based on (1) aggregation of the ontology notion instances and their attribute domains
  and subsequent probabilistic cause-consequence analysis aimed at extraction more
  informative features. The proposed technology is fully implemented and validated
  on several case studies.
