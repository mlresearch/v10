title: Feature Selection, Association Rules Network and Theory Building
abstract: As the size and dimensionality of data sets increase, the task of feature
  selection has become increasingly important. In this paper we demonstrate how association
  rules can be used to build a network of features, which we refer to as an association
  rules network, to extract features from large data sets. Association rules network
  can play a fundamental role in \it theory building - which is a task common to all
  data sciences- statistics, machine learning and data mining.
