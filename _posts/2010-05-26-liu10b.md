title: 'Feature Selection: An Ever Evolving Frontier in Data Mining'
abstract: 'The rapid advance of computer technologies in data processing, collection,
  and storage has provided unparalleled opportunities to expand capabilities in production,
  services, communications, and research. However, immense quantities of high-dimensional
  data renew the challenges to the state-of-the-art data mining techniques. Feature
  selection is an effective technique for dimension reduction and an essential step
  in successful data mining applications. It is a research area of great practical
  significance and has been developed and evolved to answer the challenges due to
  data of increasingly high dimensionality. Its direct benefits include: building
  simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data mining performance, and helping
  prepare, clean, and understand data. We first briefly introduce the key components
  of feature selection, and review its developments with the growth of data mining.
  We then overview FSDM and the papers of FSDM10, which showcases of a vibrant research
  field of some contemporary interests, new applications, and ongoing research efforts.
  We then examine nascent demands in data-intensive applications and identify some
  potential lines of research that require multidisciplinary efforts.'
