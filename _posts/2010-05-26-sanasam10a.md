title: Feature Selection for Text Classification Based on Gini Coefficient of Inequality
abstract: A number of feature selection mechanisms have been explored in text categorization,
  among which mutual information, information gain and chi-square are considered most
  effective. In this paper, we study another method known as \it within class popularity
  to deal with feature selection based on the concept \it Gini coefficient of inequality
  (a commonly used measure of inequality of \textitincome). The proposed measure explores
  the relative distribution of a feature among different classes. From extensive experiments
  with four text classifiers over three datasets of different levels of heterogeneity,
  we observe that the proposed measure outperforms the mutual information, information
  gain and chi-square static with an average improvement of approximately 28.5%, 19%
  and 9.2% respectively.
