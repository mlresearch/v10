title: Attribute Selection Based on FRiS-Compactness
abstract: Commonly to classify new object in Data Mining one should estimate its similarity
  with given classes. Function of Rival Similarity (FRiS) is assigned to calculate
  quantitative measure of similarity considering a competitive situation. FRiS-function
  allows constructing new effective algorithms for various Data Mining tasks solving.
  In particular, it enables to obtain quantitative estimation of compactness of patterns
  which can be used as indirect criterion for informative attributes selection. FRiS-compactness
  predicts reliability of recognition of control sample more precisely, than such
  widespread methods as One-Leave-Out and Cross-Validation. Presented in the paper
  results of real genetic task solving confirm efficiency of FRiS-function using in
  attributes selection and decision rules construction.
