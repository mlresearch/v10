title: Effective Wrapper-Filter hybridization through GRASP Schemata
abstract: Of all of the challenges which face the selection of relevant features for
  predictive data mining or pattern recognition modeling, the adaptation of computational
  intelligence techniques to feature selection problem requirements is one of the
  primary impediments. A new improved metaheuristic based on \textitGreedy Randomized
  Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) is proposed for the problem of Feature Selection.
  Our devised optimization approach provides an effective scheme for wrapper-filter
  hybridization through the adaptation of GRASP components. The paper investigates,
  the GRASP component design as well as its adaptation to the feature selection problem.
  Carried out experiments showed Empirical effectiveness of the devised approach.
