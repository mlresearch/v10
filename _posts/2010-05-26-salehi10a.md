title: A Statistical Implicative Analysis Based Algorithm and MMPC Algorithm for Detecting
  Multiple Dependencies
abstract: 'Discovering the dependencies among the variables of a domain from examples
  is an important problem in optimization. Many methods have been proposed for this
  purpose, but few large-scale evaluations were conducted. Most of these methods are
  based on measurements of conditional probability. The statistical implicative analysis
  offers another perspective of dependencies. It is important to compare the results
  obtained using this approach with one of the best methods currently available for
  this task: the MMPC heuristic. As the SIA is not used directly to address this problem,
  we designed an extension of it for our purpose. We conducted a large number of experiments
  by varying parameters such as the number of dependencies, the number of variables
  involved or the type of their distribution to compare the two approaches. The results
  show strong complementarities of the two methods.'
